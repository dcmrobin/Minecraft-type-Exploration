A game made in Unity, that is similar to Minecraft. I want to be able to explore an infinite world- up and down (if you go far enough down you'll encounter deepslate) as well as north south east and west- and encounter interesting land features.<br><br>
Here are some screenshots.<br><br>

I have ambient occlusion. It doesn't really go across chunks though sadly.<br><br>

You can break and place blocks. (you can only place stone at the moment, and placing a block doesn't really update light that well I think)<br><br>

There are caves. (and falloff lighting, although it doesn't really go across chunks that well either sadly.)<br><br>

Simple terrain.<br><br>

Some sort of greedy meshing, among other optimizations.<br><br>
<h3>Some of the things I want to impliment</h3>
More interesting terrain<br>
Proper cross-chunk lighting and ambient occlusion (argh howww)<br>
Biomes<br>
Ores and other land features like trees and such<br>
More optimizations<br><br>
Anyone is welcome to tell me how to do things like these ideas, as I am not that experienced in this stuff and I am using a lot of AI and trial-and-error to make some of these mechanics.
